# CCCPractice

This is some CCC (Canadian Computer Contest) practice I did when I was writing these tests. 
If you would like to know how I came up with the answer to each question (organized by the year), you can find them inside the /docs folder. 

If you are planning to write them I wish you good luck! Currently, only the junior ones are here. I will be doing the senior ones next year.

# Appreciation

I would like to thank everyone who has worked on C++, and the CCC. 
It is truly I pleasure to write them. 

Thank you!
